# hello-world
This repository contains programs which I have done from online sources and competitions.

I have done the coding questions in Java.
Use an IDE to run it, or run through command prompt on Windows(or Linux using terminal) by typing-:
> javac filename.java
> java classname
 (take inputs then)


Feel free to fork them and understand them.

Happy Coding :)
