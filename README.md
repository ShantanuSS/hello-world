## hello-to-programming

This repository contains programs which I have done from online sources and competitions.

I have done these coding questions in Java.
Use an IDE to run it, or run through command prompt on Windows(or Linux using terminal) by typing-:


* javac filename.java

* java classname
 (take inputs then)

These are not all the questions which I have ever done...These are the only some of those questions which would help people to find solutions easily
while they are practicing or coding. I only post questions just a tad which would help you all to prepare for next season of a particular coding event. 

Feel free to fork them and understand them.

# Happy Coding :)
